<!-- now write a program in Jupiter Notebook(python) which scans a qr code and checks its valid or not if yes then return true or return false. if returned true then check its bookings which is time, parking place Id which is a 10 digit hexadecimal number and then send a signal to that parking place ID to turn on green light, if return is false the send ALERT  -->

## Software 02 Verification

To achieve this functionality, you'll need to use additional libraries to handle QR code scanning and communication. The `opencv-python` library can be used for QR code scanning, and for sending signals, we'll simulate it using print statements. Please note that simulating light control and communication with parking places would require specific hardware and protocols, which are beyond the scope of this text-based interaction. Here's an outline of the code:

1. Install the required libraries:
   Install the `opencv-python` library using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

2. Import necessary modules:
   In your Jupyter Notebook cell, import the required modules:

```python
import cv2
import hashlib
import qrcode
```

3. Function to scan and process QR code:

```python
def process_qr_code(qr_data):
    # Parse the QR data into its components (time, parking place ID)
    try:
        time, place_id = qr_data.split(',')
    except ValueError:
        return False

    # Check bookings and send signals
    if check_bookings(time, place_id):
        send_green_light_signal(place_id)
        return True
    else:
        send_alert()
        return False
```

4. Function to check bookings:

```python
def check_bookings(time, place_id):
    # Implement your booking checking logic here
    # You might want to check if the specified time and parking place ID are valid
    # Return True if booking is valid, otherwise return False
    # This function depends on your specific requirements and data sources
    return True  # Replace with your actual logic
```

5. Functions to simulate signal sending:

```python
def send_green_light_signal(place_id):
    # Implement your signal sending logic here
    print(f"Green light signal sent to parking place ID: {place_id}")

def send_alert():
    # Implement your alert sending logic here
    print("ALERT: Invalid QR code scanned")
```

6. Scan the QR code and process it:

```python
# Initialize the webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # Initialize QR code detector
    qr_code_detector = cv2.QRCodeDetector()
    retval, decoded_info, points, _ = qr_code_detector.detectAndDecodeMulti(frame)

    if retval:
        qr_data = decoded_info[0]
        valid = process_qr_code(qr_data)

        if valid:
            print("QR code is valid.")
        else:
            print("QR code is not valid.")

    # Display the video feed
    cv2.imshow("QR Code Scanner", frame)

    # Exit when 'q' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the capture and close the window
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This code creates a live video feed from your webcam, scans QR codes, processes them, and simulates signal sending and alerts based on the result of processing. Please note that this is a simplified simulation, and in a real-world scenario, you would need to integrate this with appropriate hardware and communication protocols for controlling lights and sending alerts to parking places.
