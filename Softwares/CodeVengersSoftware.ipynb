        "\n",
        "1. `while True:`: This is an infinite loop that keeps running as long as the condition `True` holds. This structure ensures that the code inside the loop will be executed repeatedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `if motion_detected():`: This is a conditional statement that checks whether motion has been detected. The `motion_detected()` function is expected to be defined elsewhere in the code and would return `True` if motion is currently detected.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inside the `if` block:\n",
        "   - `image = capture_image()`: This line captures an image using a function called `capture_image()`. Presumably, this function interacts with some camera or image-capturing device and returns the captured image.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - `processed_image = process_image(image)`: The captured image is then passed to the `process_image()` function, which is expected to perform some image processing operations on the input image and return a processed version.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - `license_plate_text = extract_license_plate_text(processed_image)`: The processed image is passed to the `extract_license_plate_text()` function, which is assumed to extract the text from the license plate present in the processed image. The extracted license plate text is stored in the variable `license_plate_text`.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Nested inside this conditional, there's another `if` block:\n",
        "     - `if license_plate_text:`: This checks whether `license_plate_text` contains any text (i.e., whether a license plate was successfully extracted from the processed image).\n",
        "       - Inside this `if` block, there's another series of nested checks:\n",
        "         - `car_id = get_car_id(license_plate_text)`: The `get_car_id()` function is called with the extracted license plate text as an argument. This function is expected to map the license plate text to a corresponding car ID and return it. The car ID is stored in the `car_id` variable.\n",
        "         - Another nested `if` statement checks whether a valid `car_id` was obtained:\n",
        "           - If a valid `car_id` is found, the code proceeds to print the car ID and the current date and time using `datetime.datetime.now()`.\n",
        "           - Then, it checks if the `car_id` exists in a collection of registered car IDs stored in the `registered_cars` variable. If the car is registered, it prints a message and presumably starts some kind of countdown logic.\n",
        "           - If the car is not registered, it prints a message indicating an unregistered car and presumably triggers an alert mechanism.\n",
        "         - If `car_id` is not found, it prints a message indicating that the car ID was not found based on the extracted license plate text.\n",
        "       - If no license plate text was detected in the image, it prints a message stating that the license plate was not detected.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. `time.sleep(1)`: After each iteration of the loop, the script introduces a 1-second delay using `time.sleep(1)`. This is done to prevent the loop from executing too rapidly, which could overload system resources or slow down other operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code seems to be a basic implementation of a system that continuously monitors for motion, captures and processes images, extracts license plate text, identifies registered cars, and performs appropriate actions based on the results. It's worth noting that several functions (`motion_detected()`, `capture_image()`, `process_image()`, `extract_license_plate_text()`, and `get_car_id()`) are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code or in external modules. Additionally, the details of the \"countdown logic\" and \"send alert logic\" are not provided and would need to be implemented separately."
